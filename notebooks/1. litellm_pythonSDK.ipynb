      "Okay, so I need to figure out what 21.921 plus 23.21 equals. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Well, adding decimals can sometimes be tricky because of the decimal places, but I remember that it's similar to adding whole numbers once you line up the decimal points correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll write down both numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "21.921\n",
      "+23.210\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, why did I add an extra zero at the end? Oh right, because 23.21 is the same as 23.210 when adding decimals to match the number of decimal places. That way, each digit lines up properly in its place value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the thousandths place: 1 + 0 equals 1. Moving left to the hundredths place: 2 + 1 equals 3. Next, the tenths place: 9 + 2 equals 11. Hmm, that's more than ten, so I'll need to carry over the 1 to the next higher place.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in the tenths place, it becomes 1 instead of 11, and I carry over 1 to the units place. Now, adding the units place: 1 (from 21) + 3 (from 23) plus the carried-over 1 equals 5. Then, moving left to the tens place: 2 + 2 equals 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I get 45.131 as the sum of 21.921 and 23.210. Wait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check by adding them again without converting to whole numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe using the add tool would be more efficient. The user has access to an 'add' tool which can handle integers or floats. So, I should use that tool with the two numbers provided.\n",
